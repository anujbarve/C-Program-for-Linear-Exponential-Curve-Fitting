# C-Program-for-Linear-Exponential-Curve-Fitting
In some engineering works or scientific experiments, a certain number of data are available in a fixed interval, but they may not sufficient. A data lying in between the interval may be required. In order to find such data, a function or curve needs to be fitted using available data to get the required data through easy and convenient way.  Such technique of approximation of given data into curve which may be liner or of higher degree or exponential is known as curve fitting. It is based on the principle of least square.  A number of manipulations of data are required in curve fitting problems which take a long time to solve and are quite laborious. In order to simplify such calculations using programming approach, here I have presented source code in for linear and exponential curve fitting in C with sample output.
